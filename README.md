# Msi2
<h3>Task 2 on Msi.</h3>
Task to create neural networ. 


After first run you can comment part from

```py
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential()
```
to 
```py
model.save('handwriten.model') 
```
cause this part is only to creat model. that we are saving it after we create them.

if you want you can comment even database part but you also need to comment this part
```py
model acc and loss display
```
